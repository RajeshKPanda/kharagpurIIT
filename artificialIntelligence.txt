Everything Shall Pass Away

On a small hill overlooking a restless town lived an old watchmaker named Elias. His shop was tiny, filled with ticking clocks of every size. Some were cracked, some shiny and new, some barely worked at all—but every one of them kept moving forward.

People often came to Elias when life felt heavy.

One evening, a young man arrived, eyes tired and voice shaking. “I’ve lost my job, my friends avoid me, and nothing feels right anymore,” he said. “Tell me, does this pain ever end?”

Elias smiled gently and handed him a small brass clock. Engraved on its back were the words:
Everything shall pass away.
